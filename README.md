# CIS550 Final Project

## Project Description

We aim at providing a recipe recommendation system for users. Users are able to search for the recipe by using the name(keywords), ingredients, author, and many other interesting ways. As for a typical recipe, a user can view its basic information such as name, author, as well as cooking method in detail. As a recommendation system, we also include reviews for recipes. We support customized ways for users to get recipe information and find those which fit their needs. We will also show a radar plot for the main dishes' nutritions, one can better know his/her daily nutrition. And as a intelligent recommendation system, we will also provide similar recipes recommandation for users based on the nutritions and ingredients.

And this repository has been set visible to everyone in the SEAS department.

This colab contains the data wrangling part of the dataset and all the preprocessing that needed to be done by python.

We also include the necessary pre-computation in order to accelerate the query speed.
